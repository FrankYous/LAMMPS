My LAMMPS tutorials and trainings are done in this repository. I might eventually do my projects in multiple repos and rename this directory as well, since I am still figuring things out.

The tutorials from https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/index.php/LAMMPS_tutorials.html are stored in msstate-## folders.

Ther tutorials from https://lammpstutorials.github.io/ are stored in lmptut-## folders.
